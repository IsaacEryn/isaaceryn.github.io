# Agent Notes

## Demo Pages (scroll-driven-animation and future demos)
- Use English only on demo pages as the primary language.
- Keep English minimal and clear for non-fluent readers.
- Prefer short phrases and simple sentences.
- Use symbols or simple markers if needed (e.g., "->", "Step 1", "OK").
- For longer sentences, add a Korean translation on the next line in parentheses.
  - Wrap the Korean translation in a span with lang="ko".
- Set the page language to English: <html lang="en">.
- Use 4-space indentation in all demo HTML files.
